Version 0.6.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat,  1 Nov 2008 13:30:40 +0200

  ADDED: -q option to pkg_online_client and pkg_online_server tools
  If applied, "no matches found" message is not printed to stderr.

  .sinclude removed from Makefile

======================================================================

Version 0.5.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri, 10 Oct 2008 23:10:33 +0300

  INFO and SHORT-INFO databases contain pkg_summary(5)-formatted
  text. pkg_online_client and pkg_online_find tools run
  pkg_summary4view(1) utility for reformatting.

  New option -r added to pkg_online_client and pkg_online_find
  for printing package information in pkg_summary(5) format.
  Thus, pkg_online_client and pkg_online_server tools may effectively
  be used in conjunction with pkg_summary-utils(7).

======================================================================

Version 0.4.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 11 May 2008 18:04:38 +0300

    As of pkg_online version 0.4.0 pkg_online_find and
    pkg_online_client utilities allow queries not only in
    field:strategy:query format. Now they also allow plain text query.
    In this case a number of tries will be made to guess what you
    actually want (kind of AI :-) ). For each FIELD:STRATEGY pair in
    environment variable PKG_ONLINE_FALLBACK_RULES search is run until
    something is found.  By default PKG_ONLINE_FALLBACK_RULES contains the
    following search rules:

         PKGNAME:exact
         PKGPATH:exact
         PKGNAME:substring
         COMMENT:word
         COMMENT:substring
         DESCRIPTION:word
         DESCRIPTION:substring

    Samples of usage:

      pkg_online_find -1 dictem
      pkg_online_find -3 dict
      pkg_online_find -1 dictionary
      pkg_online_find    presentation

   You can override PKG_ONLINE_FALLBACK_RULES in your .profile.  Also
   note that the default value of this variable may change in the future.

Version 0.3.3, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 11 May 2008 11:51:53 +0300

  FIX: pkg_summary2field-index works incorrectly if PKGNAME is not
  before other fields. Now pkg_summary2field-index doesn't depend
  on fields order.

  "INDEX" is not search field. Indices are not built for it and
  it is not included to SHORTINFO and FULLINFO

  More fields are added to SHORTINFO:
    CATEGORIES, SIZE_PKG

======================================================================

Version 0.3.2, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 13 Apr 2008 13:55:03 +0300

  PKGNAME is included to short summary
  FIX: Now pkg_summary2shortinfo doesn't depend on input fields order,
     i.e.  PKGNAME should NOT be the first one.

======================================================================

Version 0.3.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri, 22 Feb 2008 00:56:09 +0200

  FIXED: -1 option may work incorrectly if multiple packages are found
  for single query

======================================================================

Version 0.3.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue,  5 Feb 2008 23:20:19 +0200

   Server can now return so called "shortinfo", see -3 option below.
   New database is created for this by pkgnew script
   pkg_summary2shortinfo: pkgsrc-XXX-shortinfo.

   pkg_summary2pkgname_to_onelineinfo script is renamed
     to pkg_summary2onelineinfo
   pkgsrc-XXX2pkgname_to_onelineinfo database is renamed
     to pkgsrc-XXX-onelineinfo

   Summary:
      pkgsrc-XXX-info         - pkg_summary2info
      pkgsrc-XXX-shortinfo    - pkg_summary2shortinfo
      pkgsrc-XXX-onelineinfo  - pkg_summary2onelineinfo

   - pkg_online_client

     new options: -1, -3 and -9 for obtaining
     oneline-, short- and full information about packages.   
     Ex: pkg_online_client -1 dict-server
         pkg_online_client -3 netcat
         pkg_online_client -1 bmake

     new options -h for help

   - pkg_online_find

     new options: -1, -3 and -9 for obtaining
     oneline-, short- and full information about packages.   
     Ex: pkg_online_find -1 'm:p:jlam'
         pkg_online_find -3 'm:p:hubertf'
         pkg_online_find -9 'm:p:tnn' 'p:p:wip/'

     new options: -f -s show available field for search and search
     strategies and their short synonyms

   Makefile.cvsdist is local to this project anymore
   (cvsdist, ChangeLog targets).
