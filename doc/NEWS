======================================================================
Version 0.13.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat,  7 Jan 2012 21:26:38 +0300

  pkg_online_client now works dramatically faster.

  Manual pages for pkg_online_client and pkg_online_find were added

  Bug in signal handlers was fixed in pkg_online_client

  License has changed from MIT to equivalent 2-clause BSD

======================================================================
Version 0.12.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 19 Mar 2011 16:54:25 +0200

  Workaround for buggy /bin/sh on DragonFlyBSD and FreeBSD<8.N.
  On these systems the following code
    set -e; if eval false; then ...; fi; echo ok
  doesn't work correctly.
  Due to this problem pkg_online_client fails.

======================================================================
Version 0.12, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 12 Feb 2011 17:40:20 +0200

  PKGBASE database is created

======================================================================
Version 0.11.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 27 Nov 2010 02:13:57 +0200

  pkg_online_find is fully reimplemented and now is a trivial wrapper
  over pkg_digger. pkg_summary-utils>=0.49.0 is needed at run time.

  Config file ~/.pkg_online_client.conf
   has been renamed to ~/.pkg_online_client

======================================================================
Version 0.10.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 17 Oct 2010 16:55:07 +0300

  Now pkg_online_client and pkg_online_find conform to POSIX Utility
      Syntax Guideline, for example, you can run the following

      pkg_online_find -r3 runawk.

  pkg_online_client/pkg_online_find and server-side tools now use
  .conf files (pkg_online_client.conf and pkg_online_server.conf)
  placed under sysconfdir directory or user's home.

  Build system has changed to mk-configure and the project structure
  has been reorganized.

  New option -n was added to pkg_online_client.

  FIX: dictd's special entries (00-database-xxx) are ignored by
  pkg_online_client.

  AI logic has moved from pkg_online_client to pkg_online_find.

  DESCRPTION:xxx entries were removed from PKG_ONLINE_FALLBACK_RULES.

  Several "dict" clients are run in parallel. This gives ~25% speed-up.

======================================================================
Version 0.9.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 27 Dec 2008 00:51:02 +0200

  FIXED: pkg_online_find fails when query contains spaces
  (missed "" around $variable)

======================================================================
Version 0.9.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Thu, 25 Dec 2008 18:11:27 +0200

  PKGPATH:PKGNAME -> PKGPATH,PKGNAME

  If PKGBASE is equal to package's directory, then only PKGPATH is
  output, otherwise PKGPATH(PKGBASE) is output.

======================================================================
Version 0.8.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Thu, 25 Dec 2008 15:47:26 +0200

  (PKGPATH,PKGNAME) pair is used as a package identifier.
  Now
    pkg_online_find -3 PKGPATH:exact:editors/emacs
  command shows an information about editors/emacs package only,
  not about editors/emacs-current having the same PKGBASE.

  Leading `-' sign is synomym to `!' and means `AND NOT.
  Example:
    pkg_online_find MAINTAINER:substring:cheusov -PKGPATH:prefix:wip/

======================================================================
Version 0.7.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Thu, 4 Dec 2008 00:18:04 +0200

  !field:strategy:query means `AND NOT'
     Example:
       pkg_online_find MAINTAINER:substring:cheusov !PKGPATH:prefix:wip/

  pkg_online_find wraps too long lines if COLUMNS environment variable
  is set and output device is terminal.

  minor fixes

======================================================================
Version 0.6.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 1 Nov 2008 13:30:40 +0200

  ADDED: -q option to pkg_online_client and pkg_online_find tools.
  If applied, "no matches found" message is not printed to stderr.

  An exit status of pkg_online_client is 20 if no matches were found.
  Command line dictionary client works the same way.

  .sinclude removed from Makefile

======================================================================
Version 0.5.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri, 10 Oct 2008 23:10:33 +0300

  INFO and SHORT-INFO databases contain pkg_summary(5)-formatted
  text. pkg_online_client and pkg_online_find tools run
  pkg_summary4view(1) utility for reformatting.

  New option -r added to pkg_online_client and pkg_online_find
  for printing package information in pkg_summary(5) format.
  Thus, pkg_online_client and pkg_online_server tools may effectively
  be used in conjunction with pkg_summary-utils(7).

======================================================================
Version 0.4.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 11 May 2008 18:04:38 +0300

    As of pkg_online version 0.4.0 pkg_online_find and
    pkg_online_client utilities allow queries not only in
    field:strategy:query format. Now they also allow plain text query.
    In this case a number of tries will be made to guess what you
    actually want (kind of AI :-) ). For each FIELD:STRATEGY pair in
    environment variable PKG_ONLINE_FALLBACK_RULES search is run until
    something is found.  By default PKG_ONLINE_FALLBACK_RULES contains the
    following search rules:

         PKGNAME:exact
         PKGPATH:exact
         PKGNAME:substring
         COMMENT:word
         COMMENT:substring
         DESCRIPTION:word
         DESCRIPTION:substring

    Samples of usage:

      pkg_online_find -1 dictem
      pkg_online_find -3 dict
      pkg_online_find -1 dictionary
      pkg_online_find    presentation

   You can override PKG_ONLINE_FALLBACK_RULES in your .profile.  Also
   note that the default value of this variable may change in the future.

======================================================================
Version 0.3.3, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 11 May 2008 11:51:53 +0300

  FIX: pkg_summary2field-index works incorrectly if PKGNAME is not
  before other fields. Now pkg_summary2field-index doesn't depend
  on fields order.

  "INDEX" is not search field. Indices are not built for it and
  it is not included to SHORTINFO and FULLINFO

  More fields are added to SHORTINFO:
    CATEGORIES, SIZE_PKG

======================================================================
Version 0.3.2, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 13 Apr 2008 13:55:03 +0300

  PKGNAME is included to short summary
  FIX: Now pkg_summary2shortinfo doesn't depend on input fields order,
     i.e.  PKGNAME should NOT be the first one.

======================================================================
Version 0.3.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri, 22 Feb 2008 00:56:09 +0200

  FIXED: -1 option may work incorrectly if multiple packages are found
  for single query

======================================================================
Version 0.3.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue,  5 Feb 2008 23:20:19 +0200

   Server can now return so called "shortinfo", see -3 option below.
   New database is created for this by pkgnew script
   pkg_summary2shortinfo: pkgsrc-XXX-shortinfo.

   pkg_summary2pkgname_to_onelineinfo script is renamed
     to pkg_summary2onelineinfo
   pkgsrc-XXX2pkgname_to_onelineinfo database is renamed
     to pkgsrc-XXX-onelineinfo

   Summary:
      pkgsrc-XXX-info         - pkg_summary2info
      pkgsrc-XXX-shortinfo    - pkg_summary2shortinfo
      pkgsrc-XXX-onelineinfo  - pkg_summary2onelineinfo

   - pkg_online_client

     new options: -1, -3 and -9 for obtaining
     oneline-, short- and full information about packages.   
     Ex: pkg_online_client -1 dict-server
         pkg_online_client -3 netcat
         pkg_online_client -1 bmake

     new options -h for help

   - pkg_online_find

     new options: -1, -3 and -9 for obtaining
     oneline-, short- and full information about packages.   
     Ex: pkg_online_find -1 'm:p:jlam'
         pkg_online_find -3 'm:p:hubertf'
         pkg_online_find -9 'm:p:tnn' 'p:p:wip/'

     new options: -f -s show available field for search and search
     strategies and their short synonyms

   Makefile.cvsdist is local to this project anymore
   (cvsdist, ChangeLog targets).

======================================================================
Version 0.2.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri,  1 Feb 2008 21:45:21 +0200

   first publicly available release
